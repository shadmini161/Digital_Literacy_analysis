# Digital_Literacy_Analysis
This Project is a Jupyter Notebook-based project that aims to provide a fully practical demonstration of Digital Literacy Analysis using Python.
## About Dataset
This dataset is designed to support research and development in improving digital literacy education in rural areas, with a focus on rural revitalization. It includes comprehensive learner interaction data, demographic attributes, and post-training outcomes, making it suitable for building adaptive and personalized learning systems.

~Key features of this dataset include:

1.Demographics: Information on age, gender, education level, employment status, household income, and location type.

2.Pre-Training Scores: Baseline scores for basic computer knowledge, internet usage, and mobile literacy.

3.Post-Training Progress: Scores achieved after training to track the impact of education modules.

4.Engagement Metrics: Data on session counts, modules completed, average time spent per module, and quiz performance.

5.Behavioral Insights: Engagement levels, adaptability scores, and learner feedback ratings.

~This dataset is ideal for:

Training and testing machine learning models for adaptive learning systems.

Analyzing the effectiveness of digital literacy programs.

Gaining insights into learner behavior and progress.

# Features:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   
Loading Data: Using pandas to read the dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.).

Overview of Data: Displaying dataset structure using .info(), .describe(), and .head().

Handling Missing Values: Identifying and filling or removing missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
Demographic Insights: Visualizing distributions of age, gender, education level, and employment status.

Training Engagement Analysis: Examining module completion rates, session counts, and time spent.

Score Improvement Analysis: Comparing age groups and technical knowledge for digital literacy scores using line plots and heatmaps.
3. Data Visualization:
   
Bar Charts & Pie Charts
Box Plots & Histograms
Heatmaps
Line Charts
